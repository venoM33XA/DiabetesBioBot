      "['Diabetes Mellitus  \\n1. What is diabetes?  \\n\\uf0b7 Diabetes is a disorder of metabolism where blood glucose (blood sugar) remains  \\ntoo high due to insufficient insulin production or inadequate action of available \\ninsulin.  \\n2. What are the types of diabetes?  \\n\\uf0b7 Basically,  diabetes mellitus can be of two types, based on how they are \\ntreated/managed. One that definitively requires insulin from the very beginning \\nfor treatment (often called type 1 DM). The  other types are those that do not \\nordinarily require insulin for treatment *. These types of diabetes are a \\nheterogenous group with type 2 DM forming the major numbers (more than 90 \\nper cent) . \\n\\uf0b7 (* All diabetics may require insulin for treatment in special s ituations).  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 There are two other conditions:  \\na) Pre-diabetes  is a condition when a person’s blood glucose levels are higher \\nthan normal but not high enough to be called Type 2 DM . These blood sugar \\nof such patients may go into the diabetic range during periods of stress.  \\n \\nb) Gestational Diabetes (GD) mellitus  resembles Type 2 Diabetes in most  \\naspects but manifest s during pregnancy. It may improve or resolve after \\nchildbirth but a small percentage may convert to type 2 diabetes  with \\nincreasing age.  \\n3. What are the common symptoms  of diabetes mellitus ? \\n\\uf0b7 Type 2 DM, which forms the largest number diabetics is largely \\nasymptomatic and detected  incidentally during  \\n\\uf0b7 Routine investigations of a health check -up \\n\\uf0b7 Investigational work -up for a surgical procedure  \\n\\uf0b7 Investigational work up during admission for any other \\ncondition, specially end -organ damage (brain stroke, \\nmyocardial infarction and/or chronic kidney disease)  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 However, these patients can present with  \\uf0b7 Recurrent infections (commonly skin and/or urinary)  \\n\\uf0b7 Delayed healing of wounds following injuries (usually foot \\ninfections)  \\n\\uf0b7 Frequent change of glasses (due to blurring of vision)  \\n\\uf0b7 Numbness of legs  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Only type 1 diabetics (those  with absolute insulin deficiency) present with \\ntypical symptoms of Increased thirst (Polydipsia), frequent micturition \\n(polyuria), increased appetite (polyphagia) and/or weight -loss (more than 10% \\nof body weight over a short period of time). Sometimes (during periods of \\nstress) all diabetics can have these symptoms, when they need to cons ult their \\ntreating doctors immediately.  \\n4. What are the risk factors for diabetes?   \\n\\uf0b7 There is no single risk factor for Diabetes. Apart from genetic predisposition \\n(which is also polygenic like hypertension), a host of acquired factors can \\ncontribute to develo pment of diabetes  mellitus:   \\n\\uf0a7 Advancing Age (> 30 years)  \\n\\uf0a7 Obesity  \\n\\uf0a7 Lifestyle factors  such as   \\na) Lack of Physical inactivity  (sedentary lifestyle ) \\nb) Stress  \\nc) Excessive consumption of simple carbohydrates \\n(including sugar), excessive fat ( especially trans -fat) \\n\\uf0a7 Alcohol consumption  \\n\\uf0a7 Certain h ormonal disorders etc.  \\n5. What are the complications of diabetes?  \\n\\uf0b7 Complications can affect various organs and systems. It mainly effects eyes \\n(Diabetic retinopathy), kidneys (Diabetic nephropathy), numbness of feet \\n(Neuropathy), D iabetic foot, Cardiovascular diseases and even death.  \\n6. How to diagnose DM ? \\n\\uf0b7 At least two abnormal values  \\n○ Fasting plasma glucose; ≥ 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dl),  \\n○ Post prandial glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dl),  \\n○ HbA1c; ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) for diabetes,  \\uf0b7 Random bloo d glucose in the presence of signs and symptoms of diabetes; ≥ 11.1 \\nmmol/L (200 mg/dl) for diabetes.  \\n7. What are the treatment modalities  available ? \\n\\uf0b7 Type 1 diabetes is to be always treated with insulin  replacement therapy.  \\n\\uf0b7 Lifestyle and diet management are required for all types of diabetes mellitus . \\n\\uf0b7 Medicine  for treatment of diabetes is available  under all systems, modern \\nmedicine as well as traditional systems such as ayurveda, homeopathy, unani \\nand siddha.  Choice between systems  is for an individual to decide , but always in \\nconsultation with the attending physician.  \\n\\uf0b7 Regular screening and treatment to avoid or delay complications.  \\n8. How can I modify my diet if I am a diabetic  so that blood sugars stay within a \\nnormal range ? \\n\\uf0b7 Please remember that human body does not like severe changes in blood sugar \\nlevels (highs as well as lows), it appreciates and responds best to blood sugar \\nlevels  (when ever they stay in a narrow range of 100 – 150 mg/dl.  \\n\\uf0b7 Any dietary intervention should be  aimed at preventing highs as well as lows \\n(hypoglycemia) . \\n\\uf0b7 Eat a maximum of three meals a day with enough spacing between them. This \\nwill ensure enough time for digestive and metabolic processes to be complete \\nbefore the next meal.  \\n\\uf0b7 Frequent eating (every 2 -3 hours) is likely to cause frequent release of insulin \\nfrom pancreas , predisposing to the side effects of frequent episodes of \\nhyperin sulinemia, that may include hypertension as well.  \\n\\uf0b7 Spread your meal over 20 -30 minutes, chewing every morsel 10 -20 times . This \\nwould reduce the glycemic index of food we eat.  Also eating slowly  ensures \\nlasting satiety (which is achieved over 20 -30 minutes and not by the amount of \\nfood intake).  \\n\\uf0b7 Don’t eat direct glucose/sucrose (sugar). There is no difference between glucose, \\nsucrose (sugar), honey  and or jaggery in terms of their impact on blood glucose.  \\nImpact of fructose (sugar in fruits) on blood glucose is relatively better.  \\n\\uf0b7 Don’t eat processed food , as it always has sugar as well as salt as preservative \\nand taste enhancer. Also , most products available may not display the sugar and \\nsalt content accurately and correctly.  \\n 9. What is Glycemic Index of Food and How much should I worry about it??  \\n\\uf0b7 It is a value assigned to food based on how fast and how high  it can raise the \\nblood glucose levels . \\n\\uf0b7 Foods with a lower glycemic index (those which raise blood glucose values \\nslowly and to a lesser extent) are good for diabetics as well as non -diabetics.  \\n\\uf0b7 Calculating glycemic index of food is not easy as it can be affected by number of \\nfactors. Therefore, available information about glycemic index from different \\nsources can be highly variable . \\n\\uf0b7 There are some food factors which can affect glycemic index, and they are listed \\nbelow:  \\na) Natural /raw  food has a lower glycemic index (e.g. salad vegetables have a \\nlower glycemic index than cooked  vegetable ; fruits have a lower glycemic \\nindex than fruit juice)  \\nb) Simple sugars and carbohydrates have a high glycemic index.  \\nc) Cooking/Preserving/Re -heating/Proces sing of food increases the glycemic \\nindex.  \\nd) Speaking of grains, coarser products have a lower glycemic index than fine \\nand refine products.  \\ne) Mixing of food (taking two items together, e.g. Dal/Pulse and Rice lowers the \\nglycemic index.  \\n\\uf0b7 The simplest way to low er glycemic index of food is to chew it properly, so that \\nfood that reaches stomach and in testines is adequately mixed with saliva.  \\n \\n10. Can the above -mentioned eating habits prevent/cure diabetes as well?  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 It is rare for diabetes to disappear by itself without dietary and therapeutic \\ninterventions . \\n\\uf0b7 The above -mentioned dietary principles can de lay if not prevent the \\nmanifestation of high blood sugars despite genetic predisposition.  \\n\\uf0b7 These dietary changes can surely  help a diabetic in achieving a better con trol of \\nglucose, with any medication (including insulin) from any System of Medicine \\nthat he uses for treatment of his diabetes.  \\n\\uf0b7 In addition, a healthy lifestyle with adequate sleep and exercise, meditation, and \\nwork -life balance, will help you manage your  blood sugar within normal range.  11. I have diabetes. What fruits can I take?  \\n\\uf0b7 Fruits high in fiber and low in sugar and sodium content have a significantly \\nlower glycemic index.  \\n\\uf0b7 Fruits with high glycemic index include watermelon, other melons , raisins, \\npineap ple, mango, ripe banana, and cranberries  (76 – 60) \\n\\uf0b7 Fruits with low glycemic index include cherries, berries, grapefruit, pears, \\napricot, orange and pomegranate  (25 – 35) \\n\\uf0b7 Kiwi, Apple, Custard apple , grapes  and Sapota (Chiku) have a moderate glycemic \\nindex  (40 – 55) \\n\\uf0b7 Dried fruits generally have a higher  glycemic index than fresh and are best \\navoided.  \\n\\uf0b7 Fruit juices (even fresh ly made ) have a higher glycemic index  than fruits.  \\n\\uf0b7 Packed juices (with no  added sugar) also have a significant amount of sugar in \\njuice concentrate and should not be consumed.  \\n \\n12. Why do I feel  numbness in my  feet?  How should I look after my feet to prevent \\ncomplications like Diabetic foot??  \\n\\uf0b7 Sensory and Motor nerves get affected in diabetes get we. One may not be able to \\nperceive hot and cold sensations and may feel numbness .  There can also be \\nneedle prick like sensations (abnormal positive sensations) in the hands and \\nfeet.  \\n\\uf0b7 You must take good care of your feet even if you don’t feel any numbness.  \\n\\uf0b7 Do’s and Don’ts of Footcare  \\nDo’s  Don’ts \\n\\uf0fc Dry feet gently, especially space \\nbetween toes after every ba th \\n\\uf0fc Check feet everyday for redness, \\nswelling, soreness, cuts, blisters, \\ncorns/cal luses  \\n\\uf0fc Use comfortable footwear, like – \\npreferably s hoes with broad toes  \\n\\uf0fc Use cotton socks as far as possible  \\uf0fd Never let the feet remain wet, after \\nbath or because of sweating  \\n\\uf0fd Never walk barefoot  \\n \\n \\n\\uf0fd Never use footwear with narrow \\ntoes  \\n \\n\\uf0fd Avoid using synthetic socke  \\n \\n13. What if I have blurring of vision ? \\n \\uf0b7 Frequent and extreme changes in blood sugar can cause blurring of vision. \\nHowever, there can be other serious issues like glaucoma , and retinal problems \\nthat can cause complete loss of vision.  \\n\\uf0b7 Please consult with your treating physician as well as a n ophthalmologis t for any \\nsuch problems.  \\n \\n14. I am receiving regular treatment for diabetes, there are times when I feel \\nextremely hungry , what should I do?  \\n\\uf0b7 Check your blood sugars, whenever this happens .', 'Do’s  Don’ts \\n\\uf0fc Dry feet gently, especially space \\nbetween toes after every ba th \\n\\uf0fc Check feet everyday for redness, \\nswelling, soreness, cuts, blisters, \\ncorns/cal luses  \\n\\uf0fc Use comfortable footwear, like – \\npreferably s hoes with broad toes  \\n\\uf0fc Use cotton socks as far as possible  \\uf0fd Never let the feet remain wet, after \\nbath or because of sweating  \\n\\uf0fd Never walk barefoot  \\n \\n \\n\\uf0fd Never use footwear with narrow \\ntoes  \\n \\n\\uf0fd Avoid using synthetic socke  \\n \\n13.

I am receiving regular treatment for diabetes, there are times when I feel \\nextremely hungry , what should I do?  \\n\\uf0b7 Check your blood sugars, whenever this happens . \\n\\uf0b7 You may be having episodes of hypoglycemia (or low blood glucose) , consult \\nyour treating physician for a possible reduction in doses of drugs and/or insulin.  \\n \\n15. Being a diabetic, what kind of exercise will be good for my well -being?  \\n\\uf0b7 At least 150 minutes/week of aerobic exercise is recommended for you.  \\n\\uf0b7 Best exercise for you would be brisk walking, yoga  (under supervision) , racket \\nsports , cycling and swimming  \\n16. Do I have to take insulin injections lifelong for control of diabetes?  \\n\\uf0b7 If you are a type -1 diabetic, the answer is ‘YES’  \\n\\uf0b7 In other types of diabetes, insulin may be required only during periods of stress  \\n17. What if I have episodes of ghabrahat , palpitation and/or sweating ? \\n\\uf0b7 While ghabrahat, palpitation, and/or sweating  could be because of low blood \\nglucose , they could also signify accompanying heart disease or angina, which \\ncould be without pain in a diabetic.  \\n18. Is diabetes mellitus caused by eating excessive sweets or sugar?  \\n\\uf0b7 Taking in excessive sweets and/or sugar leads to frequent increase in blood \\nsugar va lues which requires insulin secretion and episodes of hyperinsulinemia. \\nThis can over a period of time contribute to increase in weight (obesity), insulin \\nresistance as well as diabetes mellitus.  \\n 19. Can we replace sugar with sugar free?  \\n\\uf0b7 For taste, while one may replace sugar with sugar free, but all sugar substitutes \\nhave side effects, that could be harmful. It is best to avoid sugar  \\n \\n20. Can DM be prevented absolutely?  \\n\\uf0b7 It may not be easy to prevent diabetes mellitus, when associated with a very \\nstrong family history, but a healthy life style (as mentioned in the section on \\nhypertension) can help delay the onset to a large extent.  \\n \\n21. What are the risk factors for DM?  \\na) Family History of diabetes  \\nb) Obesity  \\nc) Sedentary life style  \\n \\n22. Will I develop DM if my parents (one or both) have it?  \\n\\uf0b7 If one or both parents have diabetes mellitus, there is a fair chance of your \\ndeveloping diabetes mellitus. However, you can delay the onset by avoiding \\ndirect simple sugar and sweets and following a healthy life style  \\n \\n23. What are the complica tions of untreated DM?  \\n\\uf0b7 Untreated diabetes mellitus can result in numerous acute and/or chronic \\ncomplications, outlined below:  \\nAcute Complications  Chronic Complications  \\n\\uf0b7 Infections of  \\na) Skin  \\nb) Genital  \\nc) Urinary  \\nd) Tuberculosis  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Coma due to high sugar  \\n\\uf0b7 Coma due to low  sugar \\n(hypoglycemia)  \\n\\uf0b7 Acute loss of vision  \\uf0b7 Retinopathy  \\n\\uf0b7 Peripheral Neuropathy  \\n\\uf0b7 Infertility  \\n\\uf0b7 Nephropathy (Renal \\nfailure)  \\n\\uf0b7 Increased \\natherosclerosis resulting \\nin stroke (both cardiac \\nand cerebral)  \\n\\uf0b7 Hypertension  \\n\\uf0b7 Most of the above -mentioned complications can result in potentially fatal events.  24. Will I still have complications even after taking regular treatment for DM? And \\nif my BSL is in control?  \\n\\uf0b7 Complications can occur despite taking treatment but they will be delayed and \\nmilder than without treatment.  \\n \\n25. How o ften should we check BSL? –  If I am not diabetic (without and with risk \\nfactors), prediabetic, Diabetic?  \\n\\uf0b7 If you are not a diabetic and without any family history of diabetes, tests once a \\nyear after the age of 30 years should be adequate.  \\n\\uf0b7 If you are a dia betic, on insulin regular monitoring of blood glucose 3 -5 times a \\nday and at least 3 times week will be required.,  \\n\\uf0b7 For a diabetic, who is on oral medicines, checking of HbA1c once in 3 -6 months \\nshould be adequate.  \\n\\uf0b7 A pre -diabetic (lady with gestational diab etes, patient with previous history of \\nabnormal blood glucose) should have his blood sugar values checked every 6 \\nmonths.  \\n \\n26. Is there any difference in readings of BSL on glucometer and in lab? Which one \\nis more accurate and reliable or preferred?  \\n\\uf0b7 Glucometer  checks capillary blood glucose, which can be up to 15% higher than \\nvenous blood glucose measured at the same time.  \\n\\uf0b7 While monitoring by glucometer becomes mandatory, when on insulin, it is not \\nrequired, when patient is on oral drugs, unless there are sympt oms suggestive of \\nhypoglycemia and/or ketoacidosis.  \\n \\n27. What are alarming readings of BSL? (Lower and higher) What to do in case I \\nhave alarmingly low or high readings?  \\n\\uf0b7 A blood glucose level of less than 60 or more than 250 mg/dl should be \\nconsidered alarming  \\n\\uf0b7 Re-check in case of same values  \\n\\uf0b7 In case same values persist on re -checking, consult your doctors immediately.  \\n 28. What is insulin resistance?  \\n\\uf0b7 When action of insulin on tissues is inadequate, it is termed as insulin resistance.  \\n \\n29. Why Do I crave for sweets even  if my blood sugar is high?  \\n\\uf0b7 Craving for sweets in a diabetic is because of episodes of hypoglycemia and/or \\nhyperinsulinemia.  \\n \\n30. What changes (inclusions and exclusions) are needed in diabetes? Does \\nstopping intake of sweets suffice?  \\n\\uf0b7 Sweets/direct sugar has to be stopped completely. However, many other \\nchanges are required to be made in the diet. These have been outlined in a \\nprevious question as well.  \\n \\n31. How does exercise affect blood sugar level —in diabetes and in non -diabetic?  \\n\\uf0b7 Exercise decreases blood sugar level, both in diabetics and non -diabetics. \\nHowever, diabetics are more at risk of having low blood sugar after exercise.  \\n \\n32. What is SMBG? What is CGM?  \\n\\uf0b7 SMBG is Self -monitoring of blood glucose. This is required only for diabetics who \\nare using insulin for tr eatment.  \\n\\uf0b7 CGM is continuous glucose monitoring. It is required only in patients with brittle \\ndiabetes (those with rapidly fluctuating glucose levels). This will also mostly be \\nrequired by diabetics on insulin therapy or certain conditions such as pregnancy \\nand post kidney transplant.  \\n \\n33. Is it mandatory that all diabetics have glucometer?  \\n\\uf0b7 It is not mandatory for all diabetics to have blood glucose. But all diabetics who \\nneed to do self -monitoring of blood glucose as mentioned above need to have a \\nglucometer.  34. Can high blood sugar affect cognition, mental health?  \\n\\uf0b7 It is more common for diabetics to have mental health problems such as \\ndepression. Hypoglycemia can affect cognition.  \\n \\n \\n35. What is the role of family and friends in DM management?  \\n\\uf0b7 Family and friends must be aware of the disease and its complications specially \\nhypoglycemia and its symptoms, when they will be required to take an \\nemergency action to prevent hospitalization, even death  \\n \\n36. What is glycosylated Hb? What is the significance?  \\n\\uf0b7 Glycosylated hemoglobin is  a test that has been used for monitoring blood sugar \\ncontrol in diabetes mellitus.  \\n\\uf0b7 It is an investigation that helps a physician know about glucose control over 12 \\nweeks. I an individual less than 70 years, it should be maintained at around 6.5 \\nor less. H owever acceptable values at 70 years or more, acceptable values are \\n10% of age (7 at 70 years, 7.5 at 75 years, 8 at 80 years, 8.5 at 85 and so on). \\nHbA1c is best monitored and interpreted by a treating physician  \\n \\n37. How do I diagnose and manage diabetes in y oung children and adolescents?  \\n\\uf0b7 Diabetes in children and adolescents is usually type 1, that is insulin requiring.  \\n\\uf0b7 These patients typically present with the classical triad of polyphagia, polydipsia \\nand polyuria.  \\n\\uf0b7 Some patients present with serious complicat ions, especially ketoacidosis. \\nPatients with ketoacidosis have pain abdomen, vomiting, feeling of moderate or \\nsevere weakness; if ignored patients have difficulty in breathing (labored \\nbreathing) and may go into shock and collapse.  \\n\\uf0b7 Children and adolescents  are in a phase of growth, therefore dietary restrictions \\nare to be maintained at a relatively lower level; instead, insulin therapy should \\nbe altered to match food intake, as per growth requirement.  \\n \\n 38. How to manage diabetes in elderly with other illnesses  and treatments?  \\n\\uf0b7 Elderly patients with diabetes may have two peculiarities. Firstly, they have \\nmultiple health issues requiring polytherapy, with a risk of multiple drug \\ninteractions. Secondly, these patients are very prone to two complications  \\na) Hypoglycemi a with hypoglycemic drugs and insulin  \\nb) Dehydration due to hyperglycemia resulting in a life -\\nthreatening hyperosmolar state because of hypernatremia. \\n(increase in sodium)  \\n \\n39. What is the effect of stress (mental and physical) on BSL in normal persons \\nand in diabetic individuals?  \\n\\uf0b7 Physical stress, like exercise, will reduce blood sugar levels.  \\n\\uf0b7 Mental stress can increase secretion of cortisol and/or adrenaline to marginally \\nincrease the blood sugar values, both in normal individuals as well as in \\ndiabetics.  \\n\\uf0b7 Ther e are no major changes in blood sugar during stress of minor surgeries \\nand/or minor injuries. However, if there is a major injury (RTA) or/and if \\nindividual has to undergo major surgeries, increase in blood sugar values are \\nanticipated and these times usua lly require insulin/or escalation of antidiabetic \\ntreatment.', 'interactions. Secondly, these patients are very prone to two complications  \\na) Hypoglycemi a with hypoglycemic drugs and insulin  \\nb) Dehydration due to hyperglycemia resulting in a life -\\nthreatening hyperosmolar state because of hypernatremia. \\n(increase in sodium)  \\n \\n39. What is the effect of stress (mental and physical) on BSL in normal persons \\nand in diabetic individuals?  \\n\\uf0b7 Physical stress, like exercise, will reduce blood sugar levels.  \\n\\uf0b7 Mental stress can increase secretion of cortisol and/or adrenaline to marginally \\nincrease the blood sugar values, both in normal individuals as well as in \\ndiabetics.  \\n\\uf0b7 Ther e are no major changes in blood sugar during stress of minor surgeries \\nand/or minor injuries. However, if there is a major injury (RTA) or/and if \\nindividual has to undergo major surgeries, increase in blood sugar values are \\nanticipated and these times usua lly require insulin/or escalation of antidiabetic \\ntreatment.  \\n \\n40. What is the effect of sleep on DM and vice versa?  \\n\\uf0b7 Adequate, restful sleep is part of a healthy life -style, essential for management of \\nall life -style diseases.  \\n\\uf0b7 However, diabetes can have a profo und effect on sleep. Low blood sugar \\n(hypoglycemia) occurring during sleep can cause nightmares and restlessness in \\nsleep. Such patients may also complain of early morning headaches.  \\n\\uf0b7 Uncontrolled hyperglycemia related metabolic changes can have a negative \\neffect on the quality of sleep, which can vary from insomnia to early morning \\nawakening. Further these patients may not feel fresh after getting up  \\n\\uf0b7 At times, high carbohydrate intake does cause drowsiness,  and laziness during \\nday time  \\n \\n \\n 41. Is taking advice from dietitian mandatory? Any diet prescription required?  \\n\\uf0b7 Learning about and managing one’s diet is essential for management of diabetes. \\nHowever, a dietary prescription is not mandatory.  \\n\\uf0b7 Diet of any individual is not to be changed completely for treatment  of diabetes. \\nChanges should be suggested within the usual diet options for the patient, and \\nthat also address the working hours of the patient.  \\n \\n42. How to manage diet and medicines while travelling?  \\n\\uf0b7 Diet and medicines are easily manageable during short trave ls. Longer travels \\nmay require greater adjustments.  \\n\\uf0b7 Some things that may help include:  \\na) Avoid long gaps and/or missing meals  \\nb) Ensure adequate hydration  \\nc) Carry snacks with themselves at all times  \\nd) Avoid taking insulin in case a meal is likely to be delayed for \\nunavoidable reason.  \\n \\n43. How to manage diabetes during prolonged fasting as during Navratri and/or \\nRamadaan?  \\n\\uf0b7 Diabetics on insulin should not fast  \\n\\uf0b7 If possible, all diabetics should refrain from fa sting  \\n\\uf0b7 Type 2 diabetics on treatment should consult their physician while deciding on \\nthe dose and timing of their drugs  \\n \\n44. Can I modify medicines when I happen to eat too much/little? How?  \\n\\uf0b7 Modification of doses of insulin can be done by an individual, based on pre -meal \\nand post -meal SMBG  \\n\\uf0b7 Modification of oral drugs is not required.  \\n \\n \\n 45. How do other minor illnesses (infections, minor injuries, etc.) affect DM? What \\nprecautions are needed?  \\n\\uf0b7 Minor illnesses and/or injuries do not affect diabetes mellitus, if its ad equately \\nmanaged or controlled.  \\n\\uf0b7 No precautions are required except that it is best to avoid injuries by being \\ncareful, because even a minor injury on the foot can turn into serious diabetic \\nfoot.  \\n \\n46. As I am on many restrictions my social life gets compromise d \\n\\uf0b7 Ordinarily, there are not many restrictions, and diabetes mellitus does not affect \\nsocial life of any individual, it is mostly a perception that needs to be addressed \\nduring a discussion with peers and one’s physician.  \\n \\n47. Can I stop medicine when my blood sugar is in normal range?  \\n\\uf0b7 It may be possible to reduce medication in a type 2 diabetic but generally not \\npossible in a patient using insulin.  \\n \\n48.

Do I have to take insulin injections lifelong for control of diabetes?  \\n\\uf0b7 If you are a type -1 diabetic, the answer is ‘YES’  \\n\\uf0b7 In other types of diabetes, insulin may be required only during periods of stress  \\n17. What if I have episodes of ghabrahat , palpitation and/or sweating ? \\n\\uf0b7 While ghabrahat, palpitation, and/or sweating  could be because of low blood \\nglucose , they could also signify accompanying heart disease or angina, which \\ncould be without pain in a diabetic.  \\n18. Is diabetes mellitus caused by eating excessive sweets or sugar?  \\n\\uf0b7 Taking in excessive sweets and/or sugar leads to frequent increase in blood \\nsugar va lues which requires insulin secretion and episodes of hyperinsulinemia. \\nThis can over a period of time contribute to increase in weight (obesity), insulin \\nresistance as well as diabetes mellitus.  \\n 19. Can we replace sugar with sugar free?  \\n\\uf0b7 For taste, while one may replace sugar with sugar free, but all sugar substitutes \\nhave side effects, that could be harmful. It is best to avoid sugar  \\n \\n20. Can DM be prevented absolutely?  \\n\\uf0b7 It may not be easy to prevent diabetes mellitus, when associated with a very \\nstrong family history, but a healthy life style (as mentioned in the section on \\nhypertension) can help delay the onset to a large extent.  \\n \\n21. What are the risk factors for DM?  \\na) Family History of diabetes  \\nb) Obesity  \\nc) Sedentary life style  \\n \\n22. Will I develop DM if my parents (one or both) have it?  \\n\\uf0b7 If one or both parents have diabetes mellitus, there is a fair chance of your \\ndeveloping diabetes mellitus. However, you can delay the onset by avoiding \\ndirect simple sugar and sweets and following a healthy life style  \\n \\n23. What are the complica tions of untreated DM?  \\n\\uf0b7 Untreated diabetes mellitus can result in numerous acute and/or chronic \\ncomplications, outlined below:  \\nAcute Complications  Chronic Complications  \\n\\uf0b7 Infections of  \\na) Skin  \\nb) Genital  \\nc) Urinary  \\nd) Tuberculosis  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Coma due to high sugar  \\n\\uf0b7 Coma due to low  sugar \\n(hypoglycemia)  \\n\\uf0b7 Acute loss of vision  \\uf0b7 Retinopathy  \\n\\uf0b7 Peripheral Neuropathy  \\n\\uf0b7 Infertility  \\n\\uf0b7 Nephropathy (Renal \\nfailure)  \\n\\uf0b7 Increased \\natherosclerosis resulting \\nin stroke (both cardiac \\nand cerebral)  \\n\\uf0b7 Hypertension  \\n\\uf0b7 Most of the above -mentioned complications can result in potentially fatal events.  24. Will I still have complications even after taking regular treatment for DM? And \\nif my BSL is in control?  \\n\\uf0b7 Complications can occur despite taking treatment but they will be delayed and \\nmilder than without treatment.  \\n \\n25. How o ften should we check BSL? –  If I am not diabetic (without and with risk \\nfactors), prediabetic, Diabetic?  \\n\\uf0b7 If you are not a diabetic and without any family history of diabetes, tests once a \\nyear after the age of 30 years should be adequate.  \\n\\uf0b7 If you are a dia betic, on insulin regular monitoring of blood glucose 3 -5 times a \\nday and at least 3 times week will be required.,  \\n\\uf0b7 For a diabetic, who is on oral medicines, checking of HbA1c once in 3 -6 months \\nshould be adequate.  \\n\\uf0b7 A pre -diabetic (lady with gestational diab etes, patient with previous history of \\nabnormal blood glucose) should have his blood sugar values checked every 6 \\nmonths.  \\n \\n26. Is there any difference in readings of BSL on glucometer and in lab? Which one \\nis more accurate and reliable or preferred?  \\n\\uf0b7 Glucometer  checks capillary blood glucose, which can be up to 15% higher than \\nvenous blood glucose measured at the same time.  \\n\\uf0b7 While monitoring by glucometer becomes mandatory, when on insulin, it is not \\nrequired, when patient is on oral drugs, unless there are sympt oms suggestive of \\nhypoglycemia and/or ketoacidosis.  \\n \\n27. What are alarming readings of BSL? (Lower and higher) What to do in case I \\nhave alarmingly low or high readings?  \\n\\uf0b7 A blood glucose level of less than 60 or more than 250 mg/dl should be \\nconsidered alarming  \\n\\uf0b7 Re-check in case of same values  \\n\\uf0b7 In case same values persist on re -checking, consult your doctors immediately.  \\n 28. What is insulin resistance?  \\n\\uf0b7 When action of insulin on tissues is inadequate, it is termed as insulin resistance.  \\n \\n29. Why Do I crave for sweets even  if my blood sugar is high?  \\n\\uf0b7 Craving for sweets in a diabetic is because of episodes of hypoglycemia and/or \\nhyperinsulinemia.  \\n \\n30. What changes (inclusions and exclusions) are needed in diabetes? Does \\nstopping intake of sweets suffice?  \\n\\uf0b7 Sweets/direct sugar has to be stopped completely. However, many other \\nchanges are required to be made in the diet. These have been outlined in a \\nprevious question as well.  \\n \\n31. How does exercise affect blood sugar level —in diabetes and in non -diabetic?  \\n\\uf0b7 Exercise decreases blood sugar level, both in diabetics and non -diabetics. \\nHowever, diabetics are more at risk of having low blood sugar after exercise.  \\n \\n32. What is SMBG? What is CGM?  \\n\\uf0b7 SMBG is Self -monitoring of blood glucose. This is required only for diabetics who \\nare using insulin for tr eatment.  \\n\\uf0b7 CGM is continuous glucose monitoring. It is required only in patients with brittle \\ndiabetes (those with rapidly fluctuating glucose levels). This will also mostly be \\nrequired by diabetics on insulin therapy or certain conditions such as pregnancy \\nand post kidney transplant.  \\n \\n33. Is it mandatory that all diabetics have glucometer?  \\n\\uf0b7 It is not mandatory for all diabetics to have blood glucose. But all diabetics who \\nneed to do self -monitoring of blood glucose as mentioned above need to have a \\nglucometer.  34. Can high blood sugar affect cognition, mental health?  \\n\\uf0b7 It is more common for diabetics to have mental health problems such as \\ndepression. Hypoglycemia can affect cognition.  \\n \\n \\n35. What is the role of family and friends in DM management?  \\n\\uf0b7 Family and friends must be aware of the disease and its complications specially \\nhypoglycemia and its symptoms, when they will be required to take an \\nemergency action to prevent hospitalization, even death  \\n \\n36. What is glycosylated Hb? What is the significance?  \\n\\uf0b7 Glycosylated hemoglobin is  a test that has been used for monitoring blood sugar \\ncontrol in diabetes mellitus.  \\n\\uf0b7 It is an investigation that helps a physician know about glucose control over 12 \\nweeks. I an individual less than 70 years, it should be maintained at around 6.5 \\nor less. H owever acceptable values at 70 years or more, acceptable values are \\n10% of age (7 at 70 years, 7.5 at 75 years, 8 at 80 years, 8.5 at 85 and so on). \\nHbA1c is best monitored and interpreted by a treating physician  \\n \\n37. How do I diagnose and manage diabetes in y oung children and adolescents?  \\n\\uf0b7 Diabetes in children and adolescents is usually type 1, that is insulin requiring.  \\n\\uf0b7 These patients typically present with the classical triad of polyphagia, polydipsia \\nand polyuria.  \\n\\uf0b7 Some patients present with serious complicat ions, especially ketoacidosis. \\nPatients with ketoacidosis have pain abdomen, vomiting, feeling of moderate or \\nsevere weakness; if ignored patients have difficulty in breathing (labored \\nbreathing) and may go into shock and collapse.  \\n\\uf0b7 Children and adolescents  are in a phase of growth, therefore dietary restrictions \\nare to be maintained at a relatively lower level; instead, insulin therapy should \\nbe altered to match food intake, as per growth requirement.  \\n \\n 38. How to manage diabetes in elderly with other illnesses  and treatments?  \\n\\uf0b7 Elderly patients with diabetes may have two peculiarities. Firstly, they have \\nmultiple health issues requiring polytherapy, with a risk of multiple drug \\ninteractions. Secondly, these patients are very prone to two complications  \\na) Hypoglycemi a with hypoglycemic drugs and insulin  \\nb) Dehydration due to hyperglycemia resulting in a life -\\nthreatening hyperosmolar state because of hypernatremia. \\n(increase in sodium)  \\n \\n39. What is the effect of stress (mental and physical) on BSL in normal persons \\nand in diabetic individuals?  \\n\\uf0b7 Physical stress, like exercise, will reduce blood sugar levels.  \\n\\uf0b7 Mental stress can increase secretion of cortisol and/or adrenaline to marginally \\nincrease the blood sugar values, both in normal individuals as well as in \\ndiabetics.  \\n\\uf0b7 Ther e are no major changes in blood sugar during stress of minor surgeries \\nand/or minor injuries. However, if there is a major injury (RTA) or/and if \\nindividual has to undergo major surgeries, increase in blood sugar values are \\nanticipated and these times usua lly require insulin/or escalation of antidiabetic \\ntreatment.'),\n",

What are the types of diabetes?  \\n\\uf0b7 Basically,  diabetes mellitus can be of two types, based on how they are \\ntreated/managed. One that definitively requires insulin from the very beginning \\nfor treatment (often called type 1 DM). The  other types are those that do not \\nordinarily require insulin for treatment *. These types of diabetes are a \\nheterogenous group with type 2 DM forming the major numbers (more than 90 \\nper cent) . \\n\\uf0b7 (* All diabetics may require insulin for treatment in special s ituations).  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 There are two other conditions:  \\na) Pre-diabetes  is a condition when a person’s blood glucose levels are higher \\nthan normal but not high enough to be called Type 2 DM . These blood sugar \\nof such patients may go into the diabetic range during periods of stress.  \\n \\nb) Gestational Diabetes (GD) mellitus  resembles Type 2 Diabetes in most  \\naspects but manifest s during pregnancy. It may improve or resolve after \\nchildbirth but a small percentage may convert to type 2 diabetes  with \\nincreasing age.  \\n3. What are the common symptoms  of diabetes mellitus ? \\n\\uf0b7 Type 2 DM, which forms the largest number diabetics is largely \\nasymptomatic and detected  incidentally during  \\n\\uf0b7 Routine investigations of a health check -up \\n\\uf0b7 Investigational work -up for a surgical procedure  \\n\\uf0b7 Investigational work up during admission for any other \\ncondition, specially end -organ damage (brain stroke, \\nmyocardial infarction and/or chronic kidney disease)  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 However, these patients can present with  \\uf0b7 Recurrent infections (commonly skin and/or urinary)  \\n\\uf0b7 Delayed healing of wounds following injuries (usually foot \\ninfections)  \\n\\uf0b7 Frequent change of glasses (due to blurring of vision)  \\n\\uf0b7 Numbness of legs  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Only type 1 diabetics (those  with absolute insulin deficiency) present with \\ntypical symptoms of Increased thirst (Polydipsia), frequent micturition \\n(polyuria), increased appetite (polyphagia) and/or weight -loss (more than 10% \\nof body weight over a short period of time). Sometimes (during periods of \\nstress) all diabetics can have these symptoms, when they need to cons ult their \\ntreating doctors immediately.  \\n4. What are the risk factors for diabetes?   \\n\\uf0b7 There is no single risk factor for Diabetes. Apart from genetic predisposition \\n(which is also polygenic like hypertension), a host of acquired factors can \\ncontribute to develo pment of diabetes  mellitus:   \\n\\uf0a7 Advancing Age (> 30 years)  \\n\\uf0a7 Obesity  \\n\\uf0a7 Lifestyle factors  such as   \\na) Lack of Physical inactivity  (sedentary lifestyle ) \\nb) Stress  \\nc) Excessive consumption of simple carbohydrates \\n(including sugar), excessive fat ( especially trans -fat) \\n\\uf0a7 Alcohol consumption  \\n\\uf0a7 Certain h ormonal disorders etc.  \\n5. What are the complications of diabetes?  \\n\\uf0b7 Complications can affect various organs and systems. It mainly effects eyes \\n(Diabetic retinopathy), kidneys (Diabetic nephropathy), numbness of feet \\n(Neuropathy), D iabetic foot, Cardiovascular diseases and even death.  \\n6. How to diagnose DM ? \\n\\uf0b7 At least two abnormal values  \\n○ Fasting plasma glucose; ≥ 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dl),  \\n○ Post prandial glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dl),  \\n○ HbA1c; ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) for diabetes,  \\uf0b7 Random bloo d glucose in the presence of signs and symptoms of diabetes; ≥ 11.1 \\nmmol/L (200 mg/dl) for diabetes.  \\n7. What are the treatment modalities  available ? \\n\\uf0b7 Type 1 diabetes is to be always treated with insulin  replacement therapy.  \\n\\uf0b7 Lifestyle and diet management are required for all types of diabetes mellitus . \\n\\uf0b7 Medicine  for treatment of diabetes is available  under all systems, modern \\nmedicine as well as traditional systems such as ayurveda, homeopathy, unani \\nand siddha.  Choice between systems  is for an individual to decide , but always in \\nconsultation with the attending physician.  \\n\\uf0b7 Regular screening and treatment to avoid or delay complications.  \\n8. How can I modify my diet if I am a diabetic  so that blood sugars stay within a \\nnormal range ? \\n\\uf0b7 Please remember that human body does not like severe changes in blood sugar \\nlevels (highs as well as lows), it appreciates and responds best to blood sugar \\nlevels  (when ever they stay in a narrow range of 100 – 150 mg/dl.  \\n\\uf0b7 Any dietary intervention should be  aimed at preventing highs as well as lows \\n(hypoglycemia) . \\n\\uf0b7 Eat a maximum of three meals a day with enough spacing between them. This \\nwill ensure enough time for digestive and metabolic processes to be complete \\nbefore the next meal.  \\n\\uf0b7 Frequent eating (every 2 -3 hours) is likely to cause frequent release of insulin \\nfrom pancreas , predisposing to the side effects of frequent episodes of \\nhyperin sulinemia, that may include hypertension as well.  \\n\\uf0b7 Spread your meal over 20 -30 minutes, chewing every morsel 10 -20 times . This \\nwould reduce the glycemic index of food we eat.  Also eating slowly  ensures \\nlasting satiety (which is achieved over 20 -30 minutes and not by the amount of \\nfood intake).  \\n\\uf0b7 Don’t eat direct glucose/sucrose (sugar). There is no difference between glucose, \\nsucrose (sugar), honey  and or jaggery in terms of their impact on blood glucose.  \\nImpact of fructose (sugar in fruits) on blood glucose is relatively better.  \\n\\uf0b7 Don’t eat processed food , as it always has sugar as well as salt as preservative \\nand taste enhancer. Also , most products available may not display the sugar and \\nsalt content accurately and correctly.  \\n 9. What is Glycemic Index of Food and How much should I worry about it??  \\n\\uf0b7 It is a value assigned to food based on how fast and how high  it can raise the \\nblood glucose levels . \\n\\uf0b7 Foods with a lower glycemic index (those which raise blood glucose values \\nslowly and to a lesser extent) are good for diabetics as well as non -diabetics.  \\n\\uf0b7 Calculating glycemic index of food is not easy as it can be affected by number of \\nfactors. Therefore, available information about glycemic index from different \\nsources can be highly variable . \\n\\uf0b7 There are some food factors which can affect glycemic index, and they are listed \\nbelow:  \\na) Natural /raw  food has a lower glycemic index (e.g. salad vegetables have a \\nlower glycemic index than cooked  vegetable ; fruits have a lower glycemic \\nindex than fruit juice)  \\nb) Simple sugars and carbohydrates have a high glycemic index.  \\nc) Cooking/Preserving/Re -heating/Proces sing of food increases the glycemic \\nindex.  \\nd) Speaking of grains, coarser products have a lower glycemic index than fine \\nand refine products.  \\ne) Mixing of food (taking two items together, e.g. Dal/Pulse and Rice lowers the \\nglycemic index.  \\n\\uf0b7 The simplest way to low er glycemic index of food is to chew it properly, so that \\nfood that reaches stomach and in testines is adequately mixed with saliva.  \\n \\n10. Can the above -mentioned eating habits prevent/cure diabetes as well?  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 It is rare for diabetes to disappear by itself without dietary and therapeutic \\ninterventions . \\n\\uf0b7 The above -mentioned dietary principles can de lay if not prevent the \\nmanifestation of high blood sugars despite genetic predisposition.  \\n\\uf0b7 These dietary changes can surely  help a diabetic in achieving a better con trol of \\nglucose, with any medication (including insulin) from any System of Medicine \\nthat he uses for treatment of his diabetes.  \\n\\uf0b7 In addition, a healthy lifestyle with adequate sleep and exercise, meditation, and \\nwork -life balance, will help you manage your  blood sugar within normal range.  11. I have diabetes. What fruits can I take?  \\n\\uf0b7 Fruits high in fiber and low in sugar and sodium content have a significantly \\nlower glycemic index.  \\n\\uf0b7 Fruits with high glycemic index include watermelon, other melons , raisins, \\npineap ple, mango, ripe banana, and cranberries  (76 – 60) \\n\\uf0b7 Fruits with low glycemic index include cherries, berries, grapefruit, pears, \\napricot, orange and pomegranate  (25 – 35) \\n\\uf0b7 Kiwi, Apple, Custard apple , grapes  and Sapota (Chiku) have a moderate glycemic \\nindex  (40 – 55) \\n\\uf0b7 Dried fruits generally have a higher  glycemic index than fresh and are best \\navoided.  \\n\\uf0b7 Fruit juices (even fresh ly made ) have a higher glycemic index  than fruits.  \\n\\uf0b7 Packed juices (with no  added sugar) also have a significant amount of sugar in \\njuice concentrate and should not be consumed.  \\n \\n12. Why do I feel  numbness in my  feet?  How should I look after my feet to prevent \\ncomplications like Diabetic foot??  \\n\\uf0b7 Sensory and Motor nerves get affected in diabetes get we. One may not be able to \\nperceive hot and cold sensations and may feel numbness .  There can also be \\nneedle prick like sensations (abnormal positive sensations) in the hands and \\nfeet.  \\n\\uf0b7 You must take good care of your feet even if you don’t feel any numbness.  \\n\\uf0b7 Do’s and Don’ts of Footcare  \\nDo’s  Don’ts \\n\\uf0fc Dry feet gently, especially space \\nbetween toes after every ba th \\n\\uf0fc Check feet everyday for redness, \\nswelling, soreness, cuts, blisters, \\ncorns/cal luses  \\n\\uf0fc Use comfortable footwear, like – \\npreferably s hoes with broad toes  \\n\\uf0fc Use cotton socks as far as possible  \\uf0fd Never let the feet remain wet, after \\nbath or because of sweating  \\n\\uf0fd Never walk barefoot  \\n \\n \\n\\uf0fd Never use footwear with narrow \\ntoes  \\n \\n\\uf0fd Avoid using synthetic socke  \\n \\n13. What if I have blurring of vision ? \\n \\uf0b7 Frequent and extreme changes in blood sugar can cause blurring of vision. \\nHowever, there can be other serious issues like glaucoma , and retinal problems \\nthat can cause complete loss of vision.  \\n\\uf0b7 Please consult with your treating physician as well as a n ophthalmologis t for any \\nsuch problems.  \\n \\n14. I am receiving regular treatment for diabetes, there are times when I feel \\nextremely hungry , what should I do?  \\n\\uf0b7 Check your blood sugars, whenever this happens .')]"

       "> There are several types of diabetes, including type 1 diabetes (T1D), type 2 diabetes (T2D), gestational diabetes, and other forms of diabetes. T1D is an autoimmune disease that affects both children and adults. It is characterized by insulin deficiency and typically requires insulin therapy to control blood glucose levels. T2D is a non-autoimmune disease that can affect people of all ages. It can be controlled through lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, or medication. Gestational diabetes is a form of diabetes that occurs during pregnancy. It typically resolves after delivery but may increase the risk of developing T2D later in life. Other types of diabetes include prediabetes, which is a condition in which blood gllucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough to meet the criteria for diabetes; and insulin resistance, which is a condition in which body cells do not respond properly to insulin."
